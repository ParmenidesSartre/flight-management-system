# FLIGHT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## PROJECT SCOPE
The purpose of the online flight management system is to ease flight management and to create a convenient and easy-to-use application for passengers, trying to buy airline tickets. The system is based on a relational database with its flight management and reservation functions. We will have a database server supporting hundreds of major cities around the world as well as thousands of flights by various airline companies. Above all, we hope to provide a comfortable user experience along with the best pricing available.
